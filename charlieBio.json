Charlie has appeared alongside and opened for numerous well known musicians and bands (including several grammy winners) such as Dreamer Isioma, Indigo D'Souza, Akie Bermiss, The Criticals, Divino Ni√±o, Eric Gordon, and Big Sam.",
    "In addition to performance, Charlie is an accomplished producer, having earned himself a name as both a mix and master engineer for indie musicians around Madison and Chicago, having been the chief engineer for MINHA and recording with several of the aformentioned acts. Charlie recently graduated in May of 2022 with a full ride music scholarship from UW Madison, and has produced a steady output of both compositional and production focused work with his extra free time in addition to keeping up his normal gig volume. When he has free time that doesn't go towards all of the above, Charlie loves to cook, meditate, write, and go out to see his fellow musicians perform."
