# The PsuedoAPI

If you've stumbled onto this repo, this is all publicly available information that my websites use.
Most (currently all) websites I have made use the formats here: files ending in "Gigs.json" are arrays of JSON objects
that contain information about upcoming shows for the artist mentioned in the file name. Files ending Bio.json are arrays of
paragraphs, used to render an artists bio prettily.

currently you can find the data here (but displayed nicely) at:
